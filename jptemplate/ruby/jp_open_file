#
# Use one of a number of methods for reading and writing the file. To
# read each line in order, you can use the each_line method, which takes
# a block as an argument, enclosed in do...end keywords, or {...}
# braces. Reading a file this way is similar to iterating over an array:

${variable descriptor of file:f} = File.open("${name of file:myfile.txt}", "r")

	${variable descriptor of file:f}.each_line do|line|
		puts "I read this line: #{line}"
	end

${variable descriptor of file:f}.close

# Read individual strings for formatted data in a number of ways. After
# opening the file use the gets method to read a line and store the
# result in a variable:
#${variable descriptor of file:f} = File.open("${name of file:myfile.txt}", "r")
#line = ${variable descriptor of file:f}.gets
#puts "The line I read is: #{line}"
